### Vein health for blood draws (via ultrasound)
- Using ultrasound to evaluate potential vein damage from serial blood draws.
- No damage found.
- Bilateral antecubitcal fossae (ACF) venous ultrasound was performed to identify potential venous wall or valve pathology related to serial blood draws of the ACF veins, with no pathology identified, suggesting further draws at this site are safe.

### Whole body MRI cancer screening
- Nothing suspicious was identified.
- Head to lower sacral non-contrast 3T T1, T2 and DWI were performed (with some regions missed for DWI), with additional FLAIR on the head region, HASTE on abdominal region and sagittal STIR on C1 to S2 were performed for cancer screening with no suspicious, potentially suspicious or likert ⅗ or greater lesions identified

# Joints

We are exploring if we can restore my joints to that of an 18 year old.

### Problem
Our joints (i.e. knees, hips, etc.) break down with age. Resulting in pain, stiffness and movement restriction. While I do not have any major joint problems, I do have small aches and pains. We are testing if we can repair normal age related damage, restore vitality, and preventatively lessen future deterioration.

### Therapy
Last week, I had 300 million bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) injected into six joints over two days: both knees, shoulders, and hips as part of a clinical trial in the Bahamas.
We may repeat this therapy as needed to achieve the outcome objectives.

MSC’s were manufactured by Cellcolabs. Injections were performed by Dr. Steven Sampson of Physical Longevity.

### Measurement
Prior to the therapy, we completed comprehensive baseline analysis of each joint with MRI and musculoskeletal ultrasound. Here were the findings:

## Joint & tendon diagnosis
+ Bilateral shoulder labral degenerative tears with paralabral cysts.
+ Tendinosis (degenerated tendons): bilateral supraspinatus rotator cuff (shoulder) with subacromial bursitis (chronic inflammation in R>L shoulders).
+ Bilateral knee chondromalacia patella (cartilage wear beneath the kneecap) with left knee mild to moderate effusion/bursitis. (fluid in knee).
+ Bilateral hip gluteus medius tendinosis (chronic degeneration). Bilateral Hip Cam impingement syndrome. (Can predispose to osteoarthritis)

### What we hope we can achieve with this therapy
Improved function, mobility, and athletic performance. Elimination of aches and pains. Potential tissue regeneration and prevention of future degeneration.

### Treatment plan
+ Intra Articular injection of bilateral shoulders, hips, and knees.
+ Bilateral supraspinatus rotator cuff and bursa injections.
+ Right shoulder anterior labrum injection.
  Bilateral hip gluteus medius tendon injections.

### What happened
The injections were completed in the Bahamas in collaboration with Cellcolabs Clinical Ltd. and Dr. Steven Sampson of Physical Longevity. 
Treatment was under a clinical trial approved by the national stem cell ethics committee in the Bahamas. 
Cellco Labs provided best-in-class, gold-standard cell manufacturing of allogeneic bone marrow-cultured mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). 
50 million MSCs were injected into each of six joints, shoulders, knees, and hips, over two days. Cells were prepared and shipped from Sweden and were cryopreserved with liquid nitrogen. 
Cells were checked for viability at the point of care in the Bahamas and injected under ultrasound guidance by Dr Sampson for proper deployment under strict protocol.

# Notable Challenges

### CONGENITAL BILATERAL IJV STENOSIS
CASE NOTES DECEMBER 2021
- 44yo male
- RIJV: 70-80% stenosis
- LIJV: 100% stenosis
- Below reference range flow in all positions on duplex bilateral IJV doppler
- Missing left transverse sinus on MRV; cerebral venous thrombosis?
- Severe headache symptoms causing to wake in the night, on acetazolamide 250 mg since 25th Jan 2022
- Likely cause: bilateral styloid + atlatl transverse process compression of the IJVs both sides; multiple signs of raised ICP on serial MRIs
- Possible TOS (thoracic outlet syndrome seen on subclavian MRA)
- 20 years history of nocturnal bruxism untreated until 2021
- No previous stroke, TIA, aphasia, blurred vision or other medical conditions.
- Deciding next steps RE tests and surgical intervention.

### LUNG B LINES
- 9 when I should have 2
- Possible pathological confirmation via hyperpolarized MRI
- Possible elimination via multi-component nebulised protocol

### GRAY HAIR
- Excessive stress, chronic depression from age 20-40 whitened my hair
- Struggling to reverse it (8/23 update 8/23 - we’ve made some meaningful progress with this formulation “Blueprint for 7% off”)

### HEART REJUVENATION

- Several heart markers including LV septal A’ mitral, Aortic root diameter, LA E’ latbasal and RVSP are all coming in decades older than my chrono age. No symptoms.
- Need to formulate a plan

### MAX HR
- In twelve months, improved from 169 bpm to 183 bpm
- Struggling to make further gains

### Appendix

[1] To determine my biological age, we have completed hundreds of biological age measurements on dozens of organs to date (see monthly notes for details). When we complete the remaining measurements, covering my 70 organs (ETA Q3 2022), we will use all measurements in a single biological age formula, with weightings for each organ based on their clinical relevance.  Until then, we are relying on 6 epigenetic clocks* to calculate whole body biological age.

*PCHorvath 1, PCHorvath 2, PCHannum, PC Phenoage, Age Horvath IEAA, Age Hannum IEAA

[2] As chlorella powder, yielding 13.5mg spermidine

[3]  Highest Quality Extra-Virgin Olive Oil
>400 HPLC (USA) measured total polyphenols or > 600 NMR measured (Europe)
>67% oleic
< peroxide under 9 meq/kg
< 0.3% free fatty acids (FFA)
>90% diacylglycerols

[4] An older free testosterone index (FTI) is indicative of caloric restriction optimal nutrition (CRON) being deployed effectively; in the context of CRON the FTI is not representative of a high accuracy biological age marker of the testes, but rather to validate that CRON is being induced but not to such an extent that FTI is going too low and too old equivalent; typically a FTI of 40 - 60 represents this. FTI or total T below the normal range is likely unhealthy, and given CRON’s mechanism of action may partially act via lowering total T and FTI, it can be thought that T above the normal range for young men (or even upper quin/quartiles) could be suboptimal for longevity. Note that NIA mouse lifespan studies have shown male mice given oestrogen show reliable mean and maximum healthspan and lifespan extension and that the human male to female centenarian ratio can be as low as 1 to 10, theoretically partially mediated by the accelerated aging effect of higher testosterone to estrogen ratios, and higher absolute T and FTI.
