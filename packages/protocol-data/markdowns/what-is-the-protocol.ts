What is the Blueprint Protocol?

The power laws of longevity science. The 20% of the effort that accounts for 80% of the benefits.
It consists of evidence based longevity protocols for diet, exercise, sleep, skin care, and more.
We spent years compiling the evidence and developing the protocol on me.
We measured the biological age of my 70+ organs and then implemented the protocols to see the effects. We repeated that process again, and again, and again until I became the most measured person in history.
It’s exactly what I do every day and earned me biomarkers that rank among best in the world.
What’s Different About Your Protocol?

We reviewed all longevity science and ranked the most powerful.  
We then did baseline biological age measurements of my organs.
We implemented the science in me.
We measured my organs again, and again, and again until I became the most measured person in history.
We achieved top 1% optimal results in my comprehensive health markers.
We made all of this information free for everyone.


Why Did You Create the Protocol?

To ask the unthinkable question, is death no longer inevitable?
To fix my own health problems
To provide a guide for everyone else to follow because everyone in health disagrees with everyone about everything making it hard to know what to do.
I decided to try and do something that the 25th century would respect (read more).
Death is our only foe.
