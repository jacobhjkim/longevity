## Bedtime

In bed by 8:30 pm because every day starts the night before. Sleep is my #1 life priority because high quality rest makes hard things easy and impossible things doable. Following the instructions below, I achieved eight months of 100% perfect sleep, here’s how:

- Reframe your identity: you are a professional sleeper
- Keep a consistent bedtime, +/- 30 min.
- Get morning light +/- 30 min of waking
- Eat earlier in the day and lighter in the afternoon/evening
- Create a 30-60 minute wind-down routine
- Maintain a bedroom temperature between 60-67°F (15-19°C)
- Avoid stimulants after ~noon.
- 1-2 hours before bed, dim lights. Red light is best (a bulb in a lamp).

## Morning

~5 am, I awake naturally as abrupt alarms can have negative effects.

- Body composition measurement: weight, fat, muscle, hydration, arterial stiffness (Withins $99 or $199)
- Breathing exercise or meditation for 5 min to get my mind and body right for the day
- My eyes get light from a 10,000 LUX (device) for 3-4 min as I’m up before the sun
- I’ll apply an Rx hair serum (see hair section) and massage my scalp with a silicone scrubber for 1-2 minutes to stimulate blood flow
