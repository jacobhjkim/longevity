## FOLLICULAR PHASE:

This phase is distinguished by the growth and maturation of ovarian follicles containing eggs, starting with the first day of menstruation and ending with ovulation. During the follicular phase estrogen starts off low and slowly increases leading up to ovulation. Progesterone remains low throughout this phase.

These hormonal changes lead to:

- An increase in estrogen levels causes increased insulin sensitivity (i.e., improves carbohydrate metabolism).
- Improved muscle synthesis: Estrogen promotes muscle recovery and growth.
- Lower core body temperature: Low progesterone levels lead to a lower core temperature, improving performance during high-intensity sessions.
- Faster recovery: Higher estrogen levels contribute to improved recovery.

### Protocol: Day 1 to ovulation (day 1 of menses to ovulation)

#### Training:

- Prioritize high intensity workouts and strength training during this phase.
- Recovery is faster, train more often.

#### Nutrition:

- Eat higher carb during this phase as insulin sensitivity is improved.
- Protein intake at 1.5 g per body weight in kg per day.

#### Supplements:

- Standard Blueprint stack
- Calcium 1200 mg daily

## LUTEAL PHASE: 
During the luteal phase, progesterone rises, peaking after ovulation and remaining high until menstruation. Estrogen also rises but decreases before ovulation.

- Increased core temperature: High progesterone elevates core temperature, reducing performance and slowing recovery.
- Insulin resistance: Progesterone decreases insulin sensitivity.
- Catabolism: Progesterone promotes muscle breakdown, requiring a higher protein intake and slowing recovery.
- Water retention: Progesterone increases water retention.
- Neurotransmitter changes: Progesterone can affect neurotransmitters like serotonin, leading to fatigue, irritability, and PMS.

### Protocol: Post ovulation to menstruation

#### Training:

- Prioritize zone 2 cardio and easier strength training.
- Recovery is slower, lower intensity and regularity of activities. 

#### Nutrition:

- Increase protein and healthy fats. Reduce carbohydrates as insulin sensitivity is reduced.
- Protein intake at 2.0 g per body weight in kg per day.
- Increase anti-inflammatory foods.
- Combat water retention with adequate electrolytes.

#### Supplements:

- Increase Sodium 200-400 mg daily
- Increase Potassium 200-400 mg daily
- Increase Magnesium 100-200 mg daily
- Ashwagandha 300-600 mg and Rhodiola Rosea 200-400 mg daily to help regulate stress, reduce bloating, and alleviate PMS symptoms during early and later luteal phase.
- Melatonin 1-3 mg nightly to help improve sleep quality and reduce inflammation.

### Late Luteal Phase: Last week to a few days before menses.

#### Training:

- Light training only. Self care activities.

#### Nutrition:

- Anti-inflammatory foods and continued hydration.

How do you identify ovulation:

1. Monitor your basal body temperature: Many wearables now track basal temperature during sleep or upon waking. Look for a 0.5 to 1.0-degree increase, which begins 1-2 days afteron the day of ovulation and often persists until menstruation.
2. Cervical mucus changes: You'll notice increased production and a change in consistencyâ€”clear, slippery, and stretchy, similar to egg whites.

### PERIMENOPAUSE AND MENOPAUSE:

#### Training:

- Focus on strength training and HIIT to maintain muscle mass and prevent insulin resistance.
- Weight-bearing activities and high-intensity exercise are critical for protecting both bone and muscle mass.

#### Nutrition:

- Increase protein intake to support muscle mass.
- Aim for 2.0 g/kg of protein per day.

#### Supplements:

- Continue with the regular Blueprint stack.
- Use Ashwagandha and Rhodiola as needed for stress and mood management.
- Magnesium: 100-200 mg daily, as needed for mood.
- Calcium: 1200 mg daily.`
