Years ago I could not stop myself from overeating everyday at 7 pm. One day out of desperation, I said “Evening Bryan, you’re fired. You make my life miserable. I can’t sleep. I’m 60 lbs overweight and I feel awful all the time.”

Giving that version of me a name and then writing down his persuasive tactics such as “tonight is the last night” or “tomorrow we’ll work extra hard to burn off the calories” gave me the tools I needed to stand my ground. Evening Bryan’s authority to eat between 5 pm and 10 pm was revoked. No matter what, Evening Bryan cannot eat food because if given the chance, he’ll eat too much and ruin life for Sleep Bryan, Morning Bryan, Work Bryan and Dad Bryan.

We all have bad habits. Things we do that we don’t really want to do. They never actually make us happy. They in fact make us sad and regretful.

Here’s one approach to move past your bad habits:

Identify a version of you that is responsible for self destructive behavior and give them a name (i.e. Evening Bryan).
Write down the persuasion techniques they use to get what they want (“today’s the last day”).
Prepare a list of rebuttals that enables you to stand your ground (“this is not what we really want”, “we know this makes us sad and regretful”).
Identify which versions of you should be in charge (i.e. Morning you) and give them the authority to make decisions on behalf of your Evening Bryan.
